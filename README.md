Homework for Module 2 - Python
Created python code on two different projects - election results and financial analysis. In the financial analysis, I found the total number of months being reviewed, the total number of profits over the time period, the average change,
the greatest increase with the date attached, as well as the greatest decrease with the date attached.

In the election results, 
I found the total number of votes cast, the total of votes for each candidate with percentages of total, as well as declared the winner based on the number of votes. 

Each of these results was created using python code and written into a text file with a matching name to display the results.
